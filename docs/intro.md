# Introduction to Physical AI

**Physical AI** refers to intelligent systems that can perceive, reason about, and interact with the physical world. Unlike pure software AI (like ChatGPT), Physical AI must handle the constraints of physics, real-time control, and uncertainty.

## Course Overview

This textbook covers the complete journey from basic ROS 2 concepts to advanced Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models running on humanoid robots.

### Why Physical AI?

> "The next generation of AI won't just generate text or images—it will generate motion and action in the physical world."

### Curriculum Structure

1. **Module 1: ROS 2 Foundations** - The nervous system of modern robots.
2. **Module 2: Simulation First** - Learning to walk before we run (physically).
3. **Module 3: Isaac Platform** - Accelerated computing for robotics.
4. **Module 4: VLA & Humanoids** - The brain of the robot.

## How to Use This Book
