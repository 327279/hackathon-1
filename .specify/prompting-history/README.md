## Purpose

This folder serves multiple purposes:
1. **Transparency:** Shows the authentic development process
2. **Reproducibility:** Others can learn from and replicate the approach
3. **Documentation:** Records decision-making throughout the project
4. **Learning:** Demonstrates effective AI-assisted development

## Usage

Each subdirectory contains:
- `prompt-[number].md` - The prompt used
- `response-[number].md` - Key outcomes (if applicable)
- Notes on any refinements or iterations
